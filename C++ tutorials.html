    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 style="font-style: normal; font-size: xx-large;">Here are some simple C++ code examples to help you understand the language:</h2>
    <ol><span style="font-size: x-large;">Hello World</span></ol>

    <div style="background-color: rgb(233, 239, 238);">
        <code style="color: rgb(230, 134, 16);">#include</code>
        <code style="color: rgb(49, 150, 12);">< iostream></code>
        <br>
        <code style="color: rgb(237, 14, 14);">int</code>
        <code>main()</code>
        <br>
        <code>{</code>
        <br>
        <code style="margin-left: 20px;">std::cout <<</code>
        <code style="color: rgb(237, 14, 14);">"Hello, World!"</code>
        <code><< std::endl;</code>
        <br>
        <code style="margin-left: 20px; color: rgb(2, 128, 2)">return</code>
        <code>0;</code>
        <br>
        <code>}</code>        
    </div>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: x-large;">output:</span>
    <div style="background-color: rgb(233, 239, 238); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
        <span style="font-size: x-large;">Hello, World!</span>
    </div>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: x-large;">C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same.</span>
    <br>
    <span style="font-size: x-large;">Some of the <b>features & key-points </b> to note about the programming language are as follows:</span>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Simple:</b> It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich library support and a variety of data-types.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Machine Independent but Platform Dependent:</b> A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Mid-level language:</b> It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Rich library support:</b> Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Speed of execution:</b> C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Pointer and direct Memory-Access:</b> C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Object-Oriented:</b> One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. Large-scale applications can be built. Procedural code becomes difficult to maintain as code-size grows.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Compiled Language:</b> C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2 style="font-style: normal; font-size: xx-large;">Here are some key points to keep in mind while working with C++:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;">Object-Oriented Programming: C++ is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it allows you to define classes and objects to model real-world entities and their behavior.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;">Strong Type System: C++ has a strong type system, which means that variables have a specific type and that type must be respected in all operations performed on that variable.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;">Low-level Access: C++ provides low-level access to system resources, which makes it a suitable choice for system programming and writing efficient code.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;">Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a large set of pre-written algorithms and data structures that can be used to simplify your code and make it more efficient.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;">Cross-platform Compatibility: C++ can be compiled and run on multiple platforms, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux, making it a versatile language for developing cross-platform applications.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;">Performance: C++ is a compiled language, which means that code is transformed into machine code before it is executed. This can result in faster execution times and improved performance compared to interpreted languages like Python.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;">Memory Management: C++ requires manual memory management, which can lead to errors if not done correctly. However, this also provides more control over the program’s memory usage and can result in more efficient memory usage.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: x-large;">Syntax: C++ has a complex syntax that can be difficult to learn, especially for beginners. However, with practice and experience, it becomes easier to understand and work with.</span></li>
